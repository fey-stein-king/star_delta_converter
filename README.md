# star-delta-converter
This is a Converter which converts resistance connected in Star formation to its equivalent delta connection and vice-versa. This was made using Python. 
You can find the code here: [converter_code.docx](https://github.com/fey-stein-king/star-delta-converter/files/11522857/converter_code.docx)


Download all the files attached in the main repository in a single folder. Run the code using any IDE and it should work.

The code is highly efficient and can even detect and display the errors in input made by the user. It also smartly provides the correct solution to their error, saving the time of the user. 

This project is in collaboaration with my friend Albin Dominic.
